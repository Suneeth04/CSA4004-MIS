## EXPLAIN

Example: Using Validation Controls in a VB Windows Forms Application
Let's say we have a simple form where the user has to input their Name, Age, and Email. We'll apply validation to these fields to ensure:

The Name field is not empty.
The Age field is a number between 18 and 100.
The Email field matches a valid email format.
1. Create a Windows Forms Application in VB
Create a new Windows Forms Application project in Visual Studio or another IDE that supports VB.NET.
2. Add Controls to the Form
Add the following controls to the form:

TextBox for Name (txtName).
TextBox for Age (txtAge).
TextBox for Email (txtEmail).
Button to submit the form (btnSubmit).
Label for displaying validation messages (lblMessage).

## CODE

Public Class Form1

    ' Button Click Event to perform validation when the Submit button is clicked
    Private Sub btnSubmit_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnSubmit.Click
        ' Clear previous messages
        lblMessage.Text = ""

        ' Validate Name - Required Field Check
        If String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(txtName.Text) Then
            lblMessage.Text &= "Name is required." & vbCrLf
        End If

        ' Validate Age - Must be a number between 18 and 100
        Dim age As Integer
        If Not Integer.TryParse(txtAge.Text, age) Then
            lblMessage.Text &= "Age must be a valid number." & vbCrLf
        ElseIf age < 18 Or age > 100 Then
            lblMessage.Text &= "Age must be between 18 and 100." & vbCrLf
        End If

        ' Validate Email - Simple email format check
        If Not IsValidEmail(txtEmail.Text) Then
            lblMessage.Text &= "Please enter a valid email address." & vbCrLf
        End If

        ' If no validation messages were shown, display success message
        If lblMessage.Text = "" Then
            lblMessage.Text = "Form submitted successfully!"
        End If
    End Sub

    ' Helper function to validate email format using a regular expression
    Private Function IsValidEmail(email As String) As Boolean
        Try
            Dim emailAddress = New System.Net.Mail.MailAddress(email)
            Return emailAddress.Address = email
        Catch ex As Exception
            Return False
        End Try
    End Function
End Class
