##EXPLAIN

Now, let's design the form by adding controls:

Add RadioButtons for Gender Selection:

In the Toolbox, find RadioButton.
Drag two RadioButtons onto the form.
Change their properties (Text):
First RadioButton → Text = "Male" → Name = rbMale
Second RadioButton → Text = "Female" → Name = rbFemale
Add CheckBoxes for Hobbies Selection:

Drag three CheckBoxes onto the form.

Change their Text and Name:
First CheckBox → Text = "Reading" → Name = cbReading
Second CheckBox → Text = "Sports" → Name = cbSports
Third CheckBox → Text = "Music" → Name = cbMusic
Add a Button to Submit the Selection:

Drag a Button onto the form.

Change its Text to "Submit" and Name it as btnSubmit.
Add a Label to Display the Result:

Drag a Label onto the form.

Set its Name to lblResult and leave its Text empty (it will show results after clicking Submit).
Step 3: Write the Code
Double-click the "Submit" Button (btnSubmit).
It will open the code window.
Copy and paste the following code inside the Form1 class:

### CODE 

Public Class Form1
    Private Sub btnSubmit_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles btnSubmit.Click
        Dim gender As String = ""

        ' Check which gender is selected
        If rbMale.Checked Then
            gender = "Male"
        ElseIf rbFemale.Checked Then
            gender = "Female"
        Else
            gender = "Not Selected"
        End If

        ' Check selected hobbies
        Dim hobbies As String = ""
        If cbReading.Checked Then hobbies &= "Reading, "
        If cbSports.Checked Then hobbies &= "Sports, "
        If cbMusic.Checked Then hobbies &= "Music, "

        ' Remove the last comma if any hobbies were selected
        If hobbies.Length > 0 Then
            hobbies = hobbies.Substring(0, hobbies.Length - 2)
        Else
            hobbies = "None"
        End If

        ' Display the result in the label
        lblResult.Text = "Gender: " & gender & vbNewLine & "Hobbies: " & hobbies
    End Sub
End Class
